# Todo
A simple, user-friendly web-based Todo list application that allows users to create, manage, and organize their tasks efficiently.

## Purpose
I wanted to try out some things I've learned recently, and also to step outside of my comfort zone and try somethings that are entirely new to me. 

Some of those things include:
- Typescript
- Rollup
- Express.js
- Bootstrap
- lodash
